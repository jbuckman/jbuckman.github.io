Hello there! I'm Jacob Buckman, currently an intern at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">MILA</a> . Usually, I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> advised by <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Jason Eisner</a>.<br><br>

My primary research interest is deep reinforcement learning. I'm especially interested in working towards provably sample-efficient methods. Current work focuses on finite-sample guarantees and latent-space modeling.<br><br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2017 with a Bachelor's in computer science and a Master's in Language Technologies, advised by <a href="http://www.phontron.com/">Graham Neubig</a> . From 2017-2018, I was a <a href="https://ai.google/brain-team">Google AI Resident</a> in San Francisco.<br><br>
