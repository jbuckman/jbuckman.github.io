Hello there! I'm Jacob Buckman, currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">MILA</a> advised by <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/person/marc-g-bellemare/">Marc Bellemare</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/">Doina Precup</a>.<br><br>

My primary research areas are deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. I'm especially interested in unifying theoretical reinforcement learning with practical deep-learning-based algorithms. My current work focuses on understanding generalization in neural networks, and how this interacts with computational decision-making.<br><br>

I graduated from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2017 with a Bachelor's in computer science and a Master's in Language Technologies, advised by <a href="http://www.phontron.com/">Graham Neubig</a>. From 2017-2018, I was a <a href="https://ai.google/brain-team">Google AI Resident</a> in San Francisco.<br><br>

I love to teach.
If you want to learn about deep learning, get some guidance on a project, or just chat about AI in general, I'd be happy to help.
Please schedule a time on <a href="https://booktime.xyz/p/jacob-buckman">BookTime</a>.<br><br>
