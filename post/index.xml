      <description>In Tensorflow: The Confusing Parts (1), I described the abstractions underlying Tensorflow at a high level in an intuitive manner. In this follow-up post, I dig more deeply, and examine how these abstractions are actually implemented. Understanding these implementation details isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily essential to writing and using Tensorflow, but it allows us to inspect and debug computational graphs.
Inspecting Graphs The computational graph is not just a nebulous, immaterial abstraction; it is a computational object that exists, and can be inspected.</description>

Introduction What is this? Who are you? I’m Jacob, a Google AI Resident. When I started the residency program in the summer of 2017, I had a lot of experience programming, and a good understanding of machine learning, but I had never used Tensorflow before. I figured that given my background I’d be able to pick it up quickly. To my surprise, the learning curve was fairly steep, and even months into the residency, I would occasionally find myself confused about how to turn ideas into Tensorflow code.</description>
