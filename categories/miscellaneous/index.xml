      <description>On August 5th, OpenAI successfully defeated top human players in a Dota 2 best-of-three series. Their AI Dota agent, called OpenAI Five, was a deep neural network trained using reinforcement learning. As a researcher studying deep reinforcement learning, as well as a long-time follower of competitive Dota 2, I found this face-off really interesting. The eventual OAI5 victory was both impressive and well-earned - congrats to the team at OpenAI, and props to the humans for a hard-fought battle!</description>
