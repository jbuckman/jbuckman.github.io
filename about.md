I'm a NYC-based deep learning researcher. I have a Bachelor's & Master's from CMU, and am a PhD candidate at McGill (Mila). I have worked at Google Brain and Microsoft Research. Currently building something new.

I enjoy mentoring people who are excited to learn about deep learning. If that describes you, please feel free to reach out to me via jacobbuckman@gmail with any questions or for general guidance. I will always respond.
